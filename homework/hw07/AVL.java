     *            a   c         u

     * where each letter in the returned list is from the tree and not from
     * the word array.
     *
     * wordSearch([h, i]) returns the list [h, i], where each letter in the
     * returned list is from the tree and not from the word array.
     *
     * wordSearch([a]) returns the list [a].
     *
     * wordSearch([]) returns an empty list [].
     *
     * wordSearch([h, u, g, e]) throws NoSuchElementException. Although all
     * 4 letters exist in the tree, there is no path that spells 'huge'.
     * The closest we can get is 'hige'.
     *
     * To do this, you must first find the deepest common ancestor of the
     * first and last letter in the word. Then traverse to the first letter
     * while adding letters on the path to the list while preserving the order
     * they appear in the word (consider adding to the front of the list).
     * Finally, traverse to the last letter while adding its ancestor letters to
     * the back of the list. Please note that there is no relationship between
     * the first and last letters, in that they may not belong to the same
     * branch. You will most likely have to split off to traverse the tree when
     * searching for the first and last letters.
     *
     * You may only use 1 list instance to complete this method. Think about
     * what type of list to use since you may have to add to the front and
     * back of the list.
     *
     * You will only need to traverse to the deepest common ancestor once.
     * From that node, go to the first and last letter of the word in one
     * traversal each. Failure to do so will result in a efficiency penalty.
     * Validating the path against the word array efficiently after traversing
     * the tree will NOT result in an efficiency penalty.
     *
     * If there exists a path between the first and last letters of the word,
     * there will only be 1 valid path.
     *
     * You may assume that the word will not contain duplicate letters.
     *
     * WARNING: Do not return letters from the passed-in word array!
     * If a path exists, the letters should be retrieved from the tree.
     * Returning any letter from the word array will result in a penalty!
